# data-101

This repo is to provide a introduction to data engineering with useful documents, links and resources to introduce yourself to data engineering.

If you are new to Python then we recommend at first following through the **resources/python_virutal_environment** document to set up your virtual environment or if you are planning to use spark-delta.
